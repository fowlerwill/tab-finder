# Tab finder

## Who
By Will Fowler.

## What
Allows you to easily find tabs with keyboard shortcuts and searching.

## Why
Because you have too many tabs open, and you remember very little about the tab you need to switch to.

## How
`Ctrl + Shift + F` will open the tab switcher, type in the tab you vaguely recall, hit enter and go. Use up/down arrows to select from the list.
