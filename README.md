# Tab finder

## Who
By Will Fowler.

## What
Allows you to easily find tabs with keyboard shortcuts and searching.

## Why
Because you have too many tabs open, and you remember very little about the tab you need to switch to.

## How
### To install:
[See the addon in the store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/super-tab-finder/), that should do the trick.
### To use:
`Ctrl + Shift + F` (`Cmd + Shift + E` on mac) will open the tab switcher, type in the tab you vaguely recall, hit enter and go. Use up/down arrows to select from the list.
